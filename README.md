--> The idea of this game is to roll the dice for each player and the player which gets the score >= 100 wins the game.

--> This consists of two players in whcih each has to roll dice untill one is confident about their score and then hold it because if the dice gets 1 as value then the player turn shifts to other and previous player loses those score.
